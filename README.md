# Reading
This repo consists of list of books essential for reading, especially for self-taught programmers who want to go beyond implementation of highly-abstracted
software engineering to undertanding the low-level details of the behind-the-scene technologies.
It contains titles for different programming languages and topics. These are not listed in the order of any importance or preference. Therefore, readers are enjoined
to explore the list to make optimal use of the content, according to their interest.
Thank you!
